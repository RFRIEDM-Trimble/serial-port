A set of C++ classes to easily handle serial ports across different platforms, built on top of boost.asio, created by Terraneo Federico in September 2009, distributed under Boost Software License, Version 1.0.

forked by ericfont from https://github.com/fedetft/serial-port, so I can turn into a vcpkg library to easily include in my own projects.
